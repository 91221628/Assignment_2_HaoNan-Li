## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Ozone <- c(41,36,12,18,NA,28)
Solar.R <- c(190,118,149,313,NA,NA)
Wind <- c(7.4,8.0,12.6,11.5,14.3,14.9)
Temp <- c(67,72,74,62,56,66)
Month <- c(5,5,5,5,5,5)
Day <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
mydata <- data.frame(Ozone,Solar.R,Wind,Temp,Month,Day)
mydata
newdata <- na.omit(mydata)
newdata
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r airquality, echo=FALSE}
attach(newdata)
plot(Ozone,Temp)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
